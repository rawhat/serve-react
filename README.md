# serve-react

Nothing particularly special. Ludicrously simple starter for a TypeScript + React
project with `esbuild`. Super easy to extend, just `npm i` whatever you need.
It will get type-checked and bundled. Wicked ðŸŽ‰

#### Requirements
(Relatively) recent versions of:
- `go`
- `node` + `npm`
- `entr`

## Run

```bash
$ npm install
$ ./serve.sh
```
